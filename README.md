Ideas:

* 2D Side-scrolling platformer / metroidvania / roguelite
* Two worlds: Alive/Real vs Decayed world
  * The player could switch between worlds intermittently?
  * Make one world a main world 
* Light is a core mechanic
  * The world is dark by default, you are the light source?
  * Beam vs Radial lights sources being a core decision the player constantly must make?
  * The player could have a companion that IS the light source (easier to animate by separating player vs moving light source)?
  * Throwable light source?
* Tile-based world
